This library is designed to control the Lynxmotion A-Pod using a
raspberry pi connected to an SCC-32 servo controller.

It was named Shalom to signify the oneness of code and hardware I hoped
to bring to the A-Pod. The peaceful interaction and co-existance in the one
platform to bring about smooth operation.
