	\section{Stage Presence/Audience Interactivity}
    	Having good stage presence can also really round out a routine. Having stage presence means that you are able to command and hold the attention of the audience, simply by your demeanor and confidence. This can be achieved by confidently introducing your routine, and talking directly to the audience.\\
        
        Audience Interactivity can include asking the audience to clap along, sing, or maybe even dance! This helps draw the \index{audience}audience in, and creates a fun and vibrant atmosphere. I employed asking the audience to clap along for \index{regionals}Regionals and States. Because I'm doing a different kind of routine for Nationals, I'm not sure if I am able to include this kind of interactivity.\\
