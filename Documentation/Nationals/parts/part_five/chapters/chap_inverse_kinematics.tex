			I have spent significant time working on the Inverse Kinematics implementation into the base operating system.\\
			
			The general goal of the completed inverse kinematics system is that I can give the robot a location I want it to walk to, and it calculates down to every last joint angle how to get there - how many steps to take, when, how far to step, what the joint angles should be, when it should move the legs, etc.\\
			
			Results are promising - I have individual leg IK completed, and now working on Body IK. Once these have been successfully merged, I can then move onto step scheduling.\\
			
			I've got an \index{MVP}\index{Minimum Viable Product} demo of moving with this type of system according to the input of a joystick. It works, but barely.\\
