		\chapter{LaTeX}
			As some readers may have noticed, this document was written using \LaTeX, a typesetting programming language. This is the first time that I've used \LaTeX for a complete technical document, so I consider this to be a research and development process in of itself.\\
			
			I had a friend that told me I should start looking into \LaTeX - I wasn't sure at first, but I picked it up and starting using it. Because of my previous programming background, I quickly took to LaTeX, and is now my preferred method of writing technical documents.\\
