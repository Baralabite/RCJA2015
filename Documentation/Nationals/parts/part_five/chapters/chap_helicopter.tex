			I'm very excited at the prospects of this system - using cheap (\$30) RC helicopters and hacking their remotes to allow me to control them using \index{MCU}MCUs.\\
			
			The system basically involves two "camera beacons" which track the location of said helicopter, feed this information back to the \index{microcontroller}microcontroller which then send signals to the hacked original remote control (which in then turn sends the signals to the helicopter).\\
			
			A very promising, and exciting system. I would like help to figure out how to track multiple helicopters at once though.\\
			
			I would be keen for this system to make an appearance at States or Nationals.\\
