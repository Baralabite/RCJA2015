			A while ago I had come up with the concept of projecting images/movies onto moving dancers. This system involved some form of camera tracking - which then (using some OpenCV code) would isolate where the humans are, and then project masked images onto them.\\
			
			This way you could select what images to project onto what person.\\
			
			Due to lack of proper equipment I had to halt development, however some promising first tests were conducted. Since then I have acquired a camera more suitable to the task, and may take up the project again at some time in the future - but not for RoboCup.\\
