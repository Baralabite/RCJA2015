	\chapter{Introduction}
    	Originally this document was a separate one entitled "BaralabaBob Technical Manual", however in this edition of the manual I have combined both the logbook and the technical manual as often I make reference to and from both.\\
        
        \textbf{NOTE: Please understand that a majority of this \index{documentation}documentation was written up to 6 months ago, in which time a lot of things may have changed. All of the sections have been reviewed recently (within 2 weeks), however there could be some \index{outdated}outdated content still lurking around.}\\
        
        \section{History}
			It was purchased to compete in RoboCup, in the dance category and as a platform for further training.\\
			
			Soon after purchasing I was asked to enter a robotics exhibit into \emph{Gumna No Sheila} in Goombungee. It had to be operational for 30 days.\\

			This robot is unique in the sense that I’m completely redesigning the control system that what is provided by Lynxmotion. Rather than the control system using traditional textual pre-programmed movements, or IK controlled movements based upon real-time control it uses an all new system where the animator uses the open source 3D modeling and animation program, Blender, to program the robot’s movements.
