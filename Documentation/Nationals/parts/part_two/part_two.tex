\part{Log}
    I'm the first to admit that I'm not great at keeping a chronological \index{log} - as you may have guessed from the rest of this document, I tend to write the logbook in blocks, but not as it's happening. This said, I do tend to leave a digital trace of my progress through frequent \index{git} commits, Facebook posts, and emails sent. I've tried to accurately compile a chronological log of major events throughout the building process of this robot based upon this information until the 29th of August, 2015 from which point I am keeping a more traditional log - filling it in "as it happens."\\
