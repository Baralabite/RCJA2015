This document outlines relevant information about the research, construction, and development of Baralaba Robotics' Open Dance performance for RoboCup Junior Australia Nationals, 2015 Adelaide.\\
        
It is my goal, as much as possible, to provide clear \index{documentation}documentation in both chronological and topical formats. It is designed to be clear so that if anyone wants to \index{recreate}recreate all or part of what I have done, they can do so with significantly less effort and time.\\
	
I plan to achieve this by providing a clear format by which I present the information through proper sectioning and \hyperref[index]{indexing}\index{index} such that should anyone want to know anything about what I have done, they can quickly look it up.\\

\index{mistake}
A significant portion of the work I have done has not been done before, and as such I had to make all the mistakes to find out how to do it properly. I want to help others not make these same mistakes in the future.\\

\textbf{NOTE:} I wrote a significant amount of this documentation in a hurry, and as such it is not by any means exhaustive, nor does it contain all the information I wanted it to. Feel free to \hyperref[contact] me at \index{email}documentation@johnrobboard.com if you want further information!
